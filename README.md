# Codility-CountDiv
Write a function:</br>
class Solution { public int solution(int A, int B, int K); }</br>
that, given three integers A, B and K, returns the number of integers within the range [A..B]</br>
that are divisible by K, i.e.:</br>
{ i : A ≤ i ≤ B, i mod K = 0 }

For example, for A = 6, B = 11 and K = 2, your function should return 3,</br> 
because there are three numbers divisible by 2 within the range [6..11],</br> 
namely 6, 8 and 10.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:</br>
A and B are integers within the range [0..2,000,000,000];</br>
K is an integer within the range [1..2,000,000,000];</br>
A ≤ B.
